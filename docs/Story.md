## Levels of "Canonimity"

There are multiple levels of cannon

- "Canon (CN)": Completely Canon, confirmed by >90% the main contributors.
- "Pseudo-Canon (PS)": The community and some main contributors say that its canon, but there are a few contributors/major community members that would consider it non-canon.
- "Fanon (FN)": The community says its canon, but a large majority of contributors/the community says it's not.
- "Non-Canon (NO)": Confirmed not-canon by contributors or by the community.
- "Branched (BR)": It is considered canon, but in a separate timeline.
- "No Votes (NV)": Either nobody has said anything, or the canon rating is pending.
