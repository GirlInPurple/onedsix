# Cells Explained

## What Are Cells?

Simple, they are `.json` files containing geometry, NPC, and other data about itself.

Cells are split into 4 sections:
- `geom`: All the geometry data about this area, it tends to be quite large.
- `npc`: All NPC data, conveniently NPC data is already stored in json, so drag-and-drop-ing your own `playerdata.json` into a cell file works perfectly!
- `stats`: Statistics about this area, like Radiation amount, what faction its claimed by, etc.
- `misc`: Miscellaneous data about this cell, usually used for mods.

For more info on specific sections, go to the [Geometry](), [NPC/Player data handling](), and [Cell Statistics]() sections/pages.
