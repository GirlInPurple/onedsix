### A Data-Gen based RPG Game/Engine

**Notice: Android support has been dropped temporally until I can figure out what and why it's breaking the entire build process.**

This project was originally started because I wanted to make a DnD-like RPG game, homebrew and all, but it has grown quite significantly since then and has basically become its own engine on top of LibGDX.

This project is based around Data-gen and allowing for any code you want to be run. Being open-source and lightweight, it makes this very easy and fast to add new features, to core or your own mod.\

I highly recommend you check out the [wiki](https://github.com/GirlInPurple/onedsix/wiki), as it has far more info than here.
